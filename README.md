# Handin5Auction
To start up the program, first you navigate into the server-folder and write "go run server.go" in a terminal twice or more times, so that you have more than one node.

Then you navigate into the client-folder and write "go run client.go" in new terminals for as many clients as you want. The terminal will prompt you for a bidder ID and you can write any number.

After that, you can write an integer to bid in an auction, "status" to check on an auction's status, "failure" to simulate a node crash and "exit" to end the client.
